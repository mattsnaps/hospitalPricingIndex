# Matthew Priebe's Hospital Pricing Project

## Problem Statement

Effective January 1, 2021 new price transparency regulations require healthcare providers to
provide the public a list of standard charges for items and services. For years providers have hid
their prices, which caused prices to vary wildly between facilities. This made it next to
impossible for consumers to shop around for the lowest cost medical care. This app will serve
as a price aggregator. A one stop shop that will allow consumers to search for procedures and
compare the standard charges across different providers.
